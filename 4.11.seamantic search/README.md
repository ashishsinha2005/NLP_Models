## NLP-driven job matching process, leveraging semantic search algorithms

## Situation:

- The conversion rate of job postings to successful hires was low due to inefficient matching of job descriptions with candidate profiles. 
- This resulted in prolonged hiring cycles and underutilized talent pools.

## Task:

- The task was to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process by enhancing the job-candidate matching system. 
- The goal was to increase the number of successful hires by better aligning job descriptions with the right candidate profiles.


## Action:

- Collaborated with the HR team to design and implement an NLP-driven semantic job-matching process. 
- The system leveraged advanced word embeddings and cosine similarity to analyze and score the relevance of job descriptions against candidate profiles, ensuring more accurate matches.




## Result:
- The implementation of the NLP-based system led to an 18% increase in the conversion rate of job postings to successful hires.
- This significantly reduced the hiring cycle time and improved the quality of candidate-job matches, leading to higher job satisfaction and retention.
