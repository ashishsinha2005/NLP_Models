## Semantic Summarization for Knowledge Base

## Situation:

- Business faced challenges in identifying customers who were unlikely to renew their licenses.
- This resulted in revenue loss, inefficient allocation of marketing resources, and missed opportunities for proactive retention strategies.

## Task:

- The objective was to create a system capable of summarizing articles into concise, actionable insights while retaining critical information.  
- This solution needed to improve information accessibility and reduce dependency on customer support teams.




## Action:

- Built an AI-driven summarization framework using transformer models like paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2  for semantic understanding and abstractive summarization. 
-  Implemented the system on AWS, utilizing S3 buckets for data storage, Boto3 for service interaction, and SageMaker for model training and deployment.


## Result:
- The framework reduced resolution time by 45%, leading to faster issue resolution. 
- Customer satisfaction scores increased by 30%, and operational costs were lowered by 25% due to more efficient knowledge base usage.
