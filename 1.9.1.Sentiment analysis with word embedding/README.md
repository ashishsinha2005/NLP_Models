## NLP-sentiment Analysis with Word embedding

## Situation:

- The company was struggling to extract detailed insights from customer reviews of products, resulting in delays in product improvements. 
- The lack of a systematic approach hindered the timely identification of key issues and feature requests.

## Task:

- The task was to implement an automated solution to efficiently analyze the reviews and extract actionable insights. 
- This would accelerate the product enhancement process while reducing the manual effort required to review feedback.


## Action:

- Implemented a sentiment analysis system using Word2Vec embeddings and trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,XGD,LGBM and XGBoost. 
- These models enabled accurate classification of customer feedback and improved question answering based on the extracted data.




## Result:
- The sentiment analysis solution led to a 30% improvement in feature enhancement by enabling faster identification of customer needs.
-  Additionally, it reduced manual review time by 40%, significantly increasing the efficiency of the product improvement cycle.
